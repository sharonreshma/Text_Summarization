# Extractive Summarization with BART

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use the BART model from Hugging Face's Transformers library for text summarization. BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) is a powerful model designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as text summarization.

## Features

- **Pre-trained Model**: Utilizes the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model for generating high-quality summaries.
- **Tokenization**: Efficiently tokenizes the input text to prepare it for model processing.
- **Summary Generation**: Generates concise summaries using beam search with specific length penalties and constraints.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face's library for natural language processing tasks.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework used for model training and inference.

## Outcomes

This project aims to achieve the following outcomes:

- **High-Quality Summaries**: Generate accurate and concise summaries of input texts using the BART model.
- **Efficient Tokenization**: Implement efficient text tokenization for processing by the BART model.
- **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Showcase advanced natural language processing techniques for text summarization tasks.
